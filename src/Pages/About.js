      <span>Sky Land Management continues to lead the way in the use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), commonly referred to as drones, for aerial application such as weed spraying and seeding.  With our recently upgraded RPAS, we are at the forefront of technology, employing the latest autonomous, precision application drones for spraying and spreading.  This latest technology provides the added benefits of swarming, using up to 5 drones working together simultaneously.  In addition, we use an integrated survey drone providing precision mapping to enhance planning and deployment of the drones.
