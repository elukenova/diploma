              <h1>Avata</h1>
              <p>
                I apologize, but I couldn't find any specific information about
                a drone model called "Avata" in my current knowledge base. It's
                possible that the Avata drone is a relatively new or
                lesser-known model, or it might be a product from a smaller or
                regional drone manufacturer. To gather more information about
                the Avata drone, I recommend conducting a search on popular
                drone retailer websites, tech forums, or reaching out to drone
                communities and enthusiasts who might have knowledge or
                experience with the Avata drone. Additionally, you can visit the
                official website or contact the manufacturer directly for
                detailed specifications, features, and availability of the Avata
                drone.
